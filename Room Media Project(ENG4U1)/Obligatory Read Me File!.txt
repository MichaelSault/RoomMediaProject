The fact that the application is in shades of grey is a design choice
to demonstrate how the room is sort of stuck in time.  The one object
that is not is the plant which originated outside of the room. 

The source code is available if you want to take a look at what all
went into the making of this 'game,' if you can call it that.  I
made the objects themselves in flash and defined their properties
using actionscript 3.

Bascially what you can expect is an interactive map of the room Jack 
his mother lived in for over six years, Jack's entire life.  By 
hovering over the different objects you can see the opinion of the 
character that file belongs to (ie. Jack, Ma or Old Nick).

This took me a lot longer than it probably should have, but in the
end I think it turned out really well.  I learned a lot making this
project and had fun doing it.  Enjoy!
